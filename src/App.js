        Understanding how software works and building code has been a basic
        requirement for every student. Programming skills vary from person to
        person and even from language to language. Monitoring the student
        performance is evident to assess and improve the programming skills.
        Though e-learning courses have paved the way to a different structure of
        learning, it is way more important to practice under supervision. The
        proposed model aims to automate the process of lab evaluation and
        assessment of programming subjects in the curriculum. The basic idea is
        to bring the IDEs of various programming languages(C, C++, Python &
        Java) to construct a single platform to write code. The automated
        platform consists of two types of logins. The first one is Faculty
        login. Faculty can login to the website using the official mail ID. They
        can add, modify or delete questions. According to the sections and
        subjects allocated, the faculty can observe the performance trends of
        all the students of the section in a given language. Test cases will be
        provided for each question. The second type of login is Student login.
        In student login, the student will be able to see all the programming
        subjects according to the section. Percentage, grades and marks will be
        provided based on the completion of test cases. Student profile
        demonstrates the whole details of the student. This project is being
        built using MERN stack web development. Resolving all the errors in
        manual evaluation, this automated tool will be very useful in assessing
        the students. The project will be deployed using Google Firebase. This
        tool will establish a bias free environment during programming.
